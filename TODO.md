## Executive Summary

A middleware system that enables infinite AI agent conversations through intelligent hierarchical compression, preserving full conversation fidelity while maintaining optimal context windows. Built as a conversation orchestration layer using PydanticAI for LLM interfaces and MCP for memory browsing tools.

## Data Models

### Node Definition

A **conversation node** is the fundamental unit of conversation storage. Each node represents a single message in the conversation and can be one of two types:

1. **User Node**: Contains a user message and optionally file attachments
2. **AI Assistant Node**: Contains an AI response and optionally includes tool calls with their results

Nodes are stored sequentially and can be compressed at different levels while maintaining full retrievability through the MCP expand_node() tool.

## Usage Example

See `chat_demo.py`

### Conversation Flow Example

**1. Original conversation (early nodes):**
```
Node 1 (user): Let's build a user authentication system for my web app

Node 2 (ai): I'll help you build a secure authentication system. Let's start with the requirements...
[Assistant response with multiple paragraphs explaining different auth approaches]

Node 3 (user): I want JWT tokens with refresh functionality
Also, should I use bcrypt for password hashing?

Node 4 (ai): Great questions! For JWT with refresh tokens, here's the approach...
[tool call: web_search('bcrypt vs argon2 password hashing 2024')]
[tool result: Found comparison of bcrypt vs Argon2. Argon2 is now recommended...]
Based on current research, I'd recommend Argon2 over bcrypt for new projects...
[Full implementation details with code examples]

Node 5 (user): How should I handle token expiration on the frontend?

Node 6 (ai): For handling token expiration, you'll want to implement automatic refresh logic...
[Tool call failed: Connection timeout]
Let me continue with the explanation without the external lookup...
[Complete explanation with code examples - 45 lines total]

... (many more nodes) ...
```

**2. Later conversation with old nodes summarized:**
```
Node 1-2: [IMPORTANT] User asked about JWT auth system. Assistant provided comprehensive overview of authentication approaches and security considerations. (47 lines)

Node 3-4: Discussed JWT refresh tokens and password hashing. Researched bcrypt vs Argon2, decided on Argon2. Included implementation examples. (62 lines)

Node 5-6: Explained frontend token expiration handling with automatic refresh flow and error recovery strategies. (45 lines)

Nodes 7-12: Implemented backend endpoints, discussed database schema, added validation middleware. (128 lines)

Recent nodes 23-26:
Node 23 (user): Should we add OAuth2 integration?

Node 24 (ai): OAuth2 would be a great addition. Let me explain how to integrate it...
[Detailed OAuth2 implementation guide]

Node 25 (user): What about multi-factor authentication?
Actually, wait - I'm getting confused about the token refresh flow we discussed earlier

Node 26 (ai): Let me get the exact details from our earlier conversation.
```

**3. Assistant uses MCP to expand old node:**
```
Node 26 (ai): Let me get the exact details from our earlier conversation.

[MCP Call: expand_node(6)]

Node Type: ai
Line Count: 45
Content: For handling token expiration, you'll want to implement automatic refresh logic. Here's the complete flow:
1. Store both access token (15min expiry) and refresh token (7 days)
2. Include access token in Authorization header for API calls
3. When you get a 401 response, automatically call /refresh endpoint
4. Update stored tokens and retry the original request
5. If refresh fails, redirect to login

Here's the JavaScript implementation:
```javascript
// Token refresh interceptor
axios.interceptors.response.use(
  response => response,
  async error => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401 && !error.config._retry) {
      error.config._retry = true;
      try {
        const newToken = await refreshToken();
        error.config.headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${newToken}`;
        return axios.request(error.config);
      } catch (refreshError) {
        redirectToLogin();
        return Promise.reject(refreshError);
      }
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

// Additional helper functions
[... rest of the 45-line implementation ...]

Now I can give you a complete answer about the refresh flow based on node 6...
